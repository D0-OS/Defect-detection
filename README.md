# Defect Detection

## Project Overview

This project is a C++ application, developed using Qt Creator, designed to analyze 2D point clouds representing a scanned cyclic surface. The primary goal is to identify and investigate defects in the surface and provide a simple, intuitive interface for interacting with the underlying algorithms.

---

## Key Features

- **Point Cloud Analysis:** Processes scanned 2D data to detect anomalies or irregularities in the surface structure.
- **Defect Marking:** Highlights areas of interest or defects for further investigation.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Includes a clean and straightforward GUI, making it accessible for users with varying levels of technical expertise.
- **Customizable Algorithms:** Enables users to interact with and adjust parameters for defect detection and analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **C++:** The core language used for algorithm implementation.
- **Qt Framework:** Provides the tools for developing the graphical user interface and managing application logic.
- **Point Cloud Processing:** Built-in support for handling and visualizing 2D point data.
